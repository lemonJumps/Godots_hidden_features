Hi! you may be wondering why this exists.
Well, godot has lots of undocumented features, and while developing games, I've often had to reach into the code to figure out what these do, and where they come from.

So, I started to write them down for reference, and decided to put them on the internet for anyone seeking these.

Ok but then why don't you add it into the documentation?
I Do want to, however my time is currently divided between my work (which I'm hoping to quit) and my development (which I'm hoping to become my actual job). But updating these documents is essentially what I can do during development.

I don't have to think about formatting, or what's appropriate, and what usage the docs want to push. I just write down what I need :D

BTW if anyone want's to create requests or rewrite this into the actual documentation please do, you have my blessing.


Also also!!!, there is no shade intended towards godot devs and everyone who helps. They have way too much stuff to deal with, they merge 15-20 pull requests every day (which is a lot of fixes/ features). 
please be nice to them!
